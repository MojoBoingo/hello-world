# hello-world

Baby's first repository, for ideas, concepts and loose things that don't constitute a project. Perhaps I'll dedicate it to something specific down the line. For now, I may as well record some simple goals of things I want to learn.

## Things To Learn

- Git/Github
- HTML/CSS (already begun)
- JavaScript
- Front End Libraries
- Python/ML

*Obviously* there's about two dozen more things but I hear it's important to not overreach, especially when you're a rookie. For example I'll want to pay special attention to learning more about API's and Node.js, but that should occur sometime between JS and Python. 

### CS50

My other goal is, upon completion of the course I'm currently doing at [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), to pause my studies there and dedicate most if not all of my focus to Harvard's CS50 course. It's possibly the most recommended course to me across all programming and computer science sources, and from what I've seen in the curriculum it should help me with all of the topics I listed above.

#### Stay a While and Listen

If for some reason I can't fathom anyone out there stops by to read this, hello! If you have any advice for me and the goals I've talked about here, I'd love to hear it.
